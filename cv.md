### Code example:
I like to solve learning problems on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/pavlogrechka) like that.

Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.

The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

  ```
  function mygcd(x, y){
  for ( let i = Math.max(x, y); i > 0; i-- ){
    if ( x % i === 0 && y % i === 0){
      return i
    }
  }
}
